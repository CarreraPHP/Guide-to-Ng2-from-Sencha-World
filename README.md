# Guide-to-Ng2-from-Sencha-World
This is a mini-book(some essential content) for the javascript developers who believe's what Sencha provides is all that available in Javascript.

So, what are the things that you will find here. Well to explain it, let me put some names below and let me know if it rings some bells to you.

- TypeScript
- NativeScript
- Ionic Framework
- Angular JS
- ES6
- Grunt
- Gulp
- Webpack
- System JS
- Visual Studio Code
- SASS *
- LESS
- Post CSS
- Compass *
- Fashion
- Babel JS
- Common JS
- AMD
- Browserify
- React JS
- Flux Architecture
- Promise
- Observable
- Immutable
- NG2
- Angular2
- Angular Material
- Bootstrap CSS
- Sencha Cmd *
- Ext JS *
- Sencha Touch *

Now tell me whether u are able to recongise the words, its Okay if you only have heared about some of it and didn't
get an chase to work based on it. Wat about the words marked with (*), _are they familier to you? are you using it on a day-to-day basis?
are every name marked are familiar? have you used SASS to theme Sencha Application?_

If you are going to answer __'YES'__ to every questions above then you are just like me and maybe just few days away from mastering the topic that 
am going to cover and i am pretty sure, there would be many things that you can teach me. :-)

If you are familiar with Ext JS and not Sencha Touch or other way around. No Problemo, 
The Ext Class system basis is all that you need to know and rest of the things are nothing in common with any other framework outside Sencha.
However, we may use them to better explain/understand the concepts.

Dont ask me **_'Wat is SASS? or How do i theme Sencha Application?'_**, if you are not aware of _SASS_, _Compass_ or _Theming_ then it means that you have still along way to go in mastering Sencha Application Development.
But don't worry about it, SASSS is just an additional tool that we can use for our comfort and Angular2 doesnt have any dependencies over it.  

Lets start learning by learning how i am going to present the contents because i have no idea how to write a book, all that i ever done was to take training and i am going to follow the same patten here. So, start with "Chapter1 - Introduction"
